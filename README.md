This is a new branch after hackathon

I used Node.js and Express.js to host the game.
Also used MongoDB Atlas for database, storing the files.



1. Install Node.js in your own machine (https://nodejs.org/), and Git

2. To run the app locally, run:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/cahs0505/langara_24.git  

git checkout post_hackathon  

npm install package  

npm run dev
(Alternatively: node index.js)

```

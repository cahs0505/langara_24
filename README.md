This is a new branch after hackathon

I used Node.js and Express.js as a server;
and MongoDB Atlas for database, which stores the files.


Also hosted the app on Render(https://render.com/):
https://langara-24.onrender.com/game.html


To run the app locally:

1. Install Node.js in your own machine (https://nodejs.org/), and obviously Git(https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Run:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/cahs0505/langara_24.git             //To clone the entire repository to your machine

git checkout post_hackathon                                      //To work on the current branch

npm install package                                              //To install all required packages
                                                                  (You can see them in package.json)

npm run dev                                                      //Run locally
(Alternatively: node index.js)

```
